Data Types

For data types, write out what makes up each one. For example, with strings write out how you create a string. For numbers, write out a few numbers.
• True - if something evals to true. 1 = 1, 1 < 3
• False - if something evals to false. 1 =2, 1 > 3
• None - used to represent the absense of value
• strings - like words. of,the
• numbers - numerical values. 1,2,3,685
• floats - real numbers with decimals. 4.5, 4.0
• lists - list of objects/vars. [1,2,3,4,pi,doctor]

String Escape Sequences

• \\ - escapes '\'
• \' - escapes '''
• \" - escapes '"'
• \a - creates alert 
• \b - backspace 
• \f - form feed 
• \n - new line 
• \r - carriage return 
• \t - tab 
• \v - vertical tab 

String Formats

• %d
• %i
• %o
• %u
• %x
• %X
• %e
• %E
• %f
• %F
• %g
• %G
• %c
